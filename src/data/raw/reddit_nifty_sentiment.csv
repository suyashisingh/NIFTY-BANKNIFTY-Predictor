Gentle reminder that Gold has outperformed Nifty 50 over last 7-8 years (!),"Gold performs better in times of war, uncertainity and global inflation, all three being a factor in last 8-10 years. Nothing new there. The really important question is, do you expect it to outperform for next 30 odd years that you should be investing for?",-0.2975,1739205552
Gentle reminder that Gold has outperformed Nifty 50 over last 7-8 years (!),"7-8 years back or even 3 years back the collective wisdom was that Gold was a dead investment, it doesn't make any contribution to the economy (which is true tbh) and that equity has performed better over long term etc etc.

Now that Gold has outperformed recently everybody talks about having gold as part of your investment portfolio and a lot of money is going into Gold ETFs or other forms of Gold investment. Gold has had its run and this may be probably a good time to avoid gold and invest in Large cap equity funds which are underperforming.

I was fortunate to make significant investments in SGBs over the years, it's now about 10% of my portfolio so I'm sitting pretty but I'm not making any more gold investments. To be honest I had no great foresight that gold will outperform, I just wanted diversification and gold seemed like a good hedge against inflation and I got lucky and SGB capital gains being tax free made it a no-brainer for me.",0.9769,1739205986

Also the last 4.5 years were an unprecedented environment when the US Fed printed trillions of dollars and effectively devalued the currency. A lot of that money flowed into gold and pumped it up. Now the Fed is slowly draining that liquidity out of the system. I doubt that gold will continue to perform as it did in the past. Who knows?

Gold's history shows both periods of out- and under-performance. If only we can predict what will happen next.",0.1027,1739206594
Gentle reminder that Gold has outperformed Nifty 50 over last 7-8 years (!),"A comment. When you look at an asset class after it has gone up, point-to-point returns would look very good for that.  Depending on the period you take, even FD could have outperformed equity.  This data is not wrong, but what matters is rolling return. And in that gold is still quite weak compared to equity.  Both return and volatility fall between debt and equity.

Gentle reminder that Gold has outperformed Nifty 50 over last 7-8 years (!),I simply put 5L in gold just few months back and its already beaten FD returns at 8.5% in 3 months,-0.4215,1739215925
Gentle reminder that Gold has outperformed Nifty 50 over last 7-8 years (!),"A country whose currency itself is still backed by its gold reserves, and is in turn one of the largest consumers of gold globally (10th or 11th I think) with ever increasing demand, is almost sure to never witness returns from gold going down. Sprinkle some nice inflation, fluctuating Repo rates and political uncertainty over it, and you have a recipe for guaranteed returns. 

But, a lot of your perspective and investment criteria is at play here. Gold and gold bonds cannot be compared with equity in the same spectrum for returns. Yes, Nifty50 might have performed below gold in the past 7-8 years, but did gold give better returns post covid? 

I believe gold and gold bonds generally give better returns in the 5-8 year cycle compared overall. Small cap equity, for instance, has always outperformed it in the longer and shorter terms in my personal experience in the last 12 years. Also, we can never really nullify the risk that nations like US and China pose over this market.",0.9438,1739208574

Is a 12% Annual Return on Nifty 50 Realistic?

Many market experts, including Gautam Duggad (Head of Research, Motilal Oswal), believe a 12% annualized return on the Nifty 50 over the long term is realistic. Here‚Äôs why:

1. Historical Returns Nifty 50 has historically delivered around 12% annual returns, thanks to India‚Äôs strong economic growth, rising corporate earnings, and increasing investor participation.
2. India‚Äôs Growth Story With favorable demographics, urbanization, consumer spending, and infrastructure development, India‚Äôs economy is poised for long-term growth‚Äîbenefiting top companies in the Nifty 50.
3. Market Resilience Despite global volatility, Indian markets have shown resilience. While returns may vary year to year, the long-term trend remains upward.
4. Power of Compounding Consistent investing, even with short-term ups and downs, can lead to significant wealth through compounding at a steady 12% return.
5. Expect Volatility Not every year will hit 12%, but over time, it‚Äôs a reasonable average return based on past data and economic fundamentals.

Bottom Line:  
A 12% return isn‚Äôt guaranteed annually, but it‚Äôs a realistic long-term target. Stay diversified, manage risks, and consider consulting a financial advisor for tailored advice.",0.9169,1742186117

Is a 12% Annualized Return on Nifty 50 Realistic Over the Long Term?,"Money next year has less value than money now. Inflation and other things. Even if there was no inflation having money in your pocket now is always better than getting it next year. So basically you discount future income by a certain percentage. It can be different depending on individual but normally it should at least be as much as inflation. 

Let's say that rate is 7%. You get money for next three years. 100 each. This year's current value is 100 but next year's current value is only 93. The money you will get after 2 years will only have a value of 87 currently.

So the discounted value of the cashflow is 100+93+87=290. Not 300.

Now let us say you were to buy a stock that will pay you its profits in form of dividend every year. That is your cashflow. Whatever dividend it pays will be discounted and added every year till as long as the company survives. Say it pays a dividend of 100 rupees every year. What is the current value of all future cash flows? 1400 rupees. That is all.

So what is the value of the stock? 1400. Because at the end of the day a stock is valuable only for the profits it can generate.

Then why don't people know what actual price of a stock should be? Because we don't know its future cashflow. in the above example we have not even included the growth of the company. Who knows what the growth will be. And that is where the uncertainty in the stock price comes from. When someone says a stock is overvalued what they are saying is that the current value of all future cashflows is less than the price of the stock. Everyone is adding their own assumption for growth rate and calculating the value. If you believe a company is going to grow while others don't the stock may be undervalued for you while it may be overvalued for others. The trick is to find stocks that others feel is overvalued but in reality is not.",0.9933,1731913462

Since the stocks markets basically function like a stochastic process or a random walk, one can use a bunch of probability based math or just call it statistics to ""distill"" or factorize the variance of the overall returns of one's portfolio into different factors, French and Fama's papers basically factorized all of one's returns into the beta (large cap index fund movement), size, value, growth and momentum factor, basically the 5 factor model, where beta accounts for most of the variance. 

There are very strong, years and years data backed research concluding that the overall market is a random walk for retail investors, under which case a factor based model should be true mathematically. 
Here's the paper but I'm certain you'll find YouTube videos explaining this than going through the paper. 
https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2287202

Most modern portfolio theory (MPT) papers are very well researched based on past data but the adage still remains that past returns is not an indicative of future returns, so diversification in different asset classes and foreign market (even if there're higher taxation rates on it than domestic assets when realized capital gains) are considered important for a sane and less risky portfolio but the 5 factor model and MPT are obviously not the same thing. 

With this, one can view ones investments and tilt them to certain types of equity to get different expected returns when investment horizons are long term, mostly 30+ years, momentum and value and growth as factors are interpreted differently often by fund managers but in essence, growth is high PE, high earnings potential from recent past earning, etc. Value is mostly interpreted as low PB or book values of companies being lower than what the corporation shares are trading at. Momentum is basically when a corporation is at an irrational run, hard to accurately gauge it but that doesn't stop people from trying and momentum funds do have a high turnover rate as well. The size factor is just large, mid, small which has also shown to be a factor, small caps overall do tend to have higher expected future growth rates than large or mid cap which is mostly realized over a very long period of time, could mean 20+ years vs large cap index (beta). 

It's really important to read the scheme and fact sheets of factor investing based mutual funds to understand what process/algorithm they use while executing their factor based index investing plan.

Investing equal amount in each of the Nifty Top 750 Indexes. ,"As a boglehead, I would think that staying with market capitalisation weight would be ideal.


However, there's nothing ""wrong"" with your allocation either.

You're just taking on additional risk and betting on small companies to give a disproportionately higher return than big companies. Who knows what the future holds.


Like... If largecap (representative of most of the market) grows by X% then if smallcap grows more than X, smallcap investment would pay out. If smallcap grows less than X, then largecap should've been higher priority.

If smallcap grows exactly by X, then market capitalisation weight would've anyway given the same growth.


As a result, when investing in any specific sector or any smallcase or any grouping of any stocks in general... During this you have to consider not just if the sector will go up or down, but that if this sector will go up or down with references to the market average. 

The market average growth is dominated by the large cap sector at market cap weights.


So I'll need a compelling case to convince me to invest beyond the market cap average (I. E. Total market index funds).

1 year and 5 year returns are just two data points. Best way to compare indices are rolling returns, which give you more data points for the same time period.

Nifty 500 has outperformed nifty 50 since small and midcap outperformed. Nifty 500 can underperform nifty when nifty 50 outperforms again. So, returns should not be criteria to compare two different indices when one is a subset of larger index. 

Ideally diversification is good but it need not be via nifty 500 only. 

A mix of equal weightages or different weightages in nifty, next 50, mid150 and smallcap 250 is also diversification. 

You may customise weightages in different percentage as per risk profile.

 The 4 indices also move at different points in time allowing more rebalancing opportunities. Diversification is utilising different asset classes which move reverse to each other at different time periods. Eg. Nifty next was underperforming nifty for some time but last one year is reverse trend.

Same can be done via equity debt gold. And within equity too.

Sharing one e.g.of diversification in equity using funds which move reverse to each other.

There are many risks in equity. The most important one is the systematic risk of market.  Market risk exists and can never be wished away.   Technically the standard deviation is used as a measure of the risk. Every equity fund would have a high standard deviation, sometimes even more than the mean! 

Investing in equity also carries other risks - and 'knowledge risk' is important.  If you pick stocks, or pick a fund manager who picks stocks, the results could vary on the selection process.

"Noob Question: Whis is ""DSP Nifty 50 Equal Weight Index Fund"" considered ""Very High Risk""","The context of the question here needs a deep dive. Most of the answers are delving into the high-risk nature of Index fund. Not sure if the u/skedaddler101 wants to understand the difference between a regular Index fund vis-a-vis this one. 

In this fund, the fund tracks the index only for the name of the company that qualifies to be a part of the Nifty 50. Besides that, the deployment of funds is in equal weights, unlike a regular index fund where it is exactly mirroring the index for their weightage too. 

From a performance perspective, the DSP NIfty 50 Equal Weight index fund has done exceedingly well and beaten the Nifty 50, however, in the long term for 2yr and 5yr window, it has underperformed the larger index.

Enlcosed is the performance -

The reason is the underweight stocks in the nifty 50 had a great outperformance over the overweight stocks. 

This investment strategy is to be considered only for the following reasons - 

a) When you already have an index exposure as a part of the core portfolio and this can be considered as a satellite fund with a smaller exposure. 

b) When you feel that the economy & its sectors are becoming more broadbased and unlike the covid phase where the profitability was concentrated with a few, you believe that the trickling effect across more companies is a play you believe in. 

c) Your conviction on the nifty 50 stocks are so high & you believe the last two quartiles have a great chance of outperforming the larger stocks in terms of weightage.

"Noob Question: Whis is ""DSP Nifty 50 Equal Weight Index Fund"" considered ""Very High Risk""","The technical answer is that when it comes to *within* a company, it's the riskiest asset available. For example, a company might issue equity or various types of bonds, all of which have a risk element attached. Within debt, there can be unsecured debt, secured debt, even within secured there can be different types of assets. Even with unsecured, there can be different types of prioritisations (whose debt gets paid first).

Put all of these together and the risk looks something like this: secured senior debt < secured junior debt < unsecured senior debt < unsecured junior debt <<< equity

(just an example, you can really slice and dice debt in a thousand different ways)

In essence, if something happens to a company, the first to perish are the equity holders. So it's automatically in high risk.

Sure, though, if you start looking within equity, you can slice them as equity of large cap companies, midcap, smallcap, etc. but the risk assessment rating isn't doing that. It's comparing equity cross the asset classes itself and not just within equity.",-0.8242,1714746349

Another fact (which is probably not relevant right now, but might be in the future) is that there are company specific limits on foreign holdings. Thus, once these limits are hit, foreign ETFs will no longer be able to track the index effectively (but this is maybe several years in the future, and perhaps the regulatory regime will relax by then)

First of all, not all mutual fund houses offer subscriptions to US/Canada based NRIs, and those that do have the requirement that you have to be physcially in India to make subscription requests (I think you can make an SIP request this way, and that is fine). The reason for having to do this physically, from my limited understanding, is that one needs permission from the SEC to offer investment products in the US, and selling them online is a grey area. Hence, fund houses stay away. 

The reason that not all fund houses offer mfs to US/Canada residents is related to FATCA and the reporting imposition it brings upon the fund houses (note: even in Europe, many funds are unwilling to manage money for US persons for this very reason).

The above discussion applies to non-ETF mutual funds (in particular, non-ETF index funds). I have tried to find out what happens in case of ETFs but I couldn't really find this information anywhere.

You can also look at historical returns of 50 vs 500 and make your decision whether the difference is meaningful.

Don't Miss Out on the Latest Real Estate Investment Opportunity in India! NSE Launches Nifty REITs and InvITs Index,">If the yield goes back into it, it will just inflate price of the units

Thanks for being patient, but I don't get this point. If you buy more of an asset, it does not necessarily equate to higher prices... It means you're buying more of the asset, which could be at the same price, or higher or lower (a lot of buying simultaneously can push prices up but you would also need sellers at higher prices - otherwise they won't even sell). 

This is what happens for mutual funds to be precise. But real estate is also an asset, and I think REITs should work in a similar manner. Your yields would get reinvested into buying more property without paying taxes. This property could be either be a steal deal, similar price to other properties in the REIT or an overinflated property, but the decision is on the REIT.

>When the yield lands in pocket, it is used for other purposes like expenses or buying growth stocks. Real-estate is a FIRE strategy for me, fixed income, less/no work.

This makes sense, some people may prefer a steady income in case of rainy days. Though again these yields are taxed at tax slab which may kill a lot of yield and also add to your active income (issues magnify as soon as your income hits 50L/1Cr/2Cr etc.).

Don't Miss Out on the Latest Real Estate Investment Opportunity in India! NSE Launches Nifty REITs and InvITs Index,"Appreciate the good discussion.

REIT comprises of assets mostly(threshold is predefined) which are ready to generate income or already do. New units are added _infrequently_.

So, when the yield is reinvested by everyone, the same units will have more demand but the supply is constrained. By that logic, the prices of units would go up. Currently also the demand keeps changing causing fluctuation in price but a constant demand by existing holders is a ‚Äúpumping‚Äù strategy, much like in stocks but there it makes sense because a company can have opportunities to improve their margins but real-estate don‚Äôt.

With reinvestment, either MF will buy new units, because it has to with the money, from sellers at the price they want to get or it increases it‚Äôs own NAV to account for the inflow assuming no or very few sellers in the fund. MF also will have to keep certain amount of money invested. This could be a slow process by comparison to stocks but it will happen. Real estate is a straight-forward and easy business.

And India has only very few options to invest in. Too early, diversification is bad and not having the option to diversify is worst.",0.5652,1681634939

Gold vs Nifty returns over the last 15 years,"This analysis suffers from lot of recency bias. This is in no way an argument in favor of having Gold in portfolio. To be clear, I'm saying this analysis can be better, and not an adequate argument in favor of Gold. 

Not questioning whether Gold should or should not be in portfolio.

Following are some counter-arguments.

Gold has had a dream run in last one year, and the way compounding works, late stages of returns affect overall returns. So 5, 10, 15 year returns would start to look great or poor, if your time period end on date with great or poor 1-3 year returns, respectively.

On 9th January, GoldBeES fell by 2.69% in a day, from NAV of 36.2207 to 35.2472. Yesterday, it was down by 0.33%. 

That's what it means by having a hedge - it comes with a cost. When the good / happy outcome happens, your portfolio can go down due to the hedge going the other way.

If you check domestic Gold prices between 2012 and 2018, it's mostly traded sideways or actually went down. This idea needs to be revisited, that Gold is a perfect hedge for recession, because 2015-16 were recessionary for some countries; and yet Gold prices in native currencies didn't go up.

India hasn't had a recession in its bookish sense, since we're a developing country; so there's no way to actually test historic performance of Gold's domestic prices at recessionary times and predict with certainty how it'd do in an actual recession.

When you hold a chaos asset, you need actual chaos to test if that really works as a chaos asset  or not. Such assets would do nothing for years, and suddenly go up hugely, for few months during threat of war and recession. You need much more patience, and because there are no fundamentals, you can't be sure if you're sitting on an overvalued or undervalued assets.

> If you hold SGBs till maturity there is no capital gains tax unlike buying & selling the index. Also if you buy SGB from the secondary market, you can buy it at a discount as compared to a current SGB.

SGB is a relatively recent Govt. scheme. This is Govt. giving TOA to generate interests. It used to be 3% earlier, and now 2.5% (taxable income). There's always a clock on these things, and subject to Govt. whims and tweaks.

Note that it is 2.5% simple interest. 

And you get tax exemption only if you hold that SGB to maturity. If you sell it after 5th year in secondary markets, capital gains are fully taxable. Imagine if Gold has a dream run in 6th or 7th year of SGB holding, and you want to sell it to rebalance, because you are worried it might do poor in 1 year after this, reducing your gains. Would you rather hold it to benefit from exemption on Capital Gains taxes?

SGB benefits India Govt., in the sense that they can raise capital from retail users and buy Gold. SGB hasn't been around long enough for us to know if it actually helps end retail users, who are investing in it to reach a financial goal.",0.8713,1578732925

Secondary reason is to show that **Gold can be decent investment to consider for diversification with Nifty**.

From my original post 

> Nifty dividends come to around 1.3% year, I think. If you buy something like Sovereign Gold Bonds, you get 2.5% interest per year.

I didn't use TRI because I can invest in gold through SGBs & I would have to figure out a growth figure for Gold value including the interest income. SGBs have given 2.5 or 2.75% interest per year (the ones I have are 2.75%). So we would need to add that also.

Anyway, if we change your table to that for Nifty instead of Nifty TRI  

>  |15 May 2009|16 May 2019|CAGR
-|---|---|---
NIfty |3671.65|11257.10|11.85%
Gold|14810|31980|8.0%


> An arbitrary 10 year frame for point-to-point returns. 

How is it arbitrary?  

Anyway, another such 10 year period

>  |1 Jan 2008|1 Jan2018|CAGR
-|---|---|---
NIfty |6144.35|10435.55|5.5%
Gold|10859.1|26885.5|9.5%

So gold comes out better  

So what we have    
- In the last 15 years, they have done similar  
- In a 10 year period picked by you, Nifty did better  
- In another 10 year period picked by me, Gold did better  

So overall, I can say that Gold is a good additional investment to consider along with Nifty to diversify your investment classes.

A better way to evaluate financial instruments is to see how they perform over extended time periods. You can check that for gold and silver and us stocks yourself using the links I provided. Try out 10 years, 30, 50, etc. Move the windows around, see what turns up.

Ideally though one should go a step further and emulate a proper dollar cost averaging scheme (aka our sips) in all the instruments and then see how they perform over the longer term (preferably matching it with the expected investment duration for the specific person. Btw, that's precisely why equity while being great in general is a bad choice for someone whose investment duration is short.). Then you must find out all such windows of time and find the statistical distribution of the returns. That's how you go about this.

How does volatility in ETF prices due to demand and supply impact their returns, particularly regarding potential misalignment with their underlying benchmarks?

Hi Vishal,

As mentioned in the title, I am feeling quite confused about my investment strategy. I am trying to create an all-ETF portfolio comprising both Indian and foreign indices. My plan is to set it up as a custom smallcase, allowing me to invest a fixed amount in this basket of ETFs every month. I also intend to periodically rebalance the weightage and step up my investment as my salary grows.

However, I am uncertain because most of these ETFs are also available as Mutual Funds or Funds of Funds (FoFs), which I could set up as a SIP in Coin for the same value. I am trying to determine which option would be better for my long-term investment horizon.

Any insights or advice on whether to stick with the ETF approach or switch to Mutual Funds/FoFs would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks for your questions.

**For your first question**  
The chances of any passive product whether an ETF/Index Fund to be misaligned with the underlying benchmark is minimal assuming that the fund is being managed diligently. You could keep track of the tracking error of each fund which is disseminated regularly on AMC websites.

**For your second question**  
The misalignment in trading price of an ETF with the iNAV/fair value of the ETF could be due to many factors. ETFs depend on market markers (MM) to provide liquidity and there have been instances during stress periods when ETFs have traded away from fair value. This generally happens if the MM is not able to price the ETF fairly as some of the stocks are in circuit & also due t**o** funding issues of the MM during stress periods in the market. We are cognizant of this issue and as an industry are working towards various solutions to reduce these instances.

**For your third question**  
I wouldn't be the right person to comment on schemes managed by other AMCs. However, in terms of replication, as these segments are still evolving, liquidity can be an issue which may be leading to higher tracking error. At Zerodha Fund House, we have taken a conscious call to wait before we launch a product in this segment until we are confident of replicating with a reasonable tracking error.

Most of the operational costs incurred by any scheme are based on percentage (%) of AUM including Index Service provider fees. The exact numbers depends on the agreement between both the parties

There are certain charges which are higher for a smaller AUM fund, which is why economies of scale start playing out as the AUM increases.

ETFs and Index Funds have their unique use cases and have their pros and cons.

For the ETF's, AMC ensures enough liquidity through the market makers to honour orders of all sizes provided they are within the prevailing prices and spreads quoted by the Market Maker.

While ETFs can be bought/ sold at real-time prices, Index Funds are only bought at closing NAV and therefore an ETF always gives you an optionality to take benefit of intra-day movements/pricing.

ETFs being listed and traded real-time, there have been certain occasions on extremely volatile days when Market Makers have not been able to quote due to certain underlying stocks being at circuit or due to funding issues, but this is rare and over the years has become better.

A lot of work still needs to be done in improving the market making ecosystem in India and my belief is it will keep getting better as we go ahead.

The mutual fund structure is a bit elaborate and will try and explain it in simple terms. The MF structure consists of a Trust and the Asset Management Company (AMC) that is appointed by the Trust and manages the assets.

An investors‚Äô money lies with the Trust and the Trustees ensure that guidelines are followed as per the  regulations viz., SEBI (Mutual Funds) Regulations, 1996 (‚ÄòMF Regulations‚Äô).

As per MF Regulations, the fund houses are required to maintain transparency and adhere to stringent compliance norms. These regulations include provisions for the protection of investors' interests, such as regular audits and disclosures. SEBI ensures that fund houses operate within a regulatory framework.¬†Also, all the schemes' investments are held by the appointed custodian in the respective name of the scheme.

Therefore even if something happens with AMC then also the investments of Mutual Fund Schemes are protected as they are independent from the AMC.

Tracking Error is calculated as the standard deviation of the differences between the fund's returns and the benchmark index's returns over a specific period. A high tracking error indicates that the fund's performance is diverging significantly from the benchmark, while a low tracking error suggests the fund is closely mirroring the benchmark.  

AMCs generally do two things to minimize it:

1) Efficiently deploy the capital that it receives in the underlying index constituents such that you are tracking the index any any given point of time with a low cash drag

2) Ensuring any rebalances owing to change in index constituents are managed with a low impact on tracking error

See it depends on the type of investor you are. Its completely possible and feasible to create the entire portfolio using just Mutual Funds and ETFs. On a personal level, that's what I have done in my portfolio.

But if as an investor you feel you can benefit from taking exposure to any of the structures - PMS, AIF etc, you can definitely go ahead.

Long story short, choosing these products is not a function of the amount you want to put. It's more to do with your philosophy. The Index Fund/ ETF structure is good enough irrespective of your investment amount.

I would also incline towards building it with a core satellite philosophy, where your core is into a broad based, multi asset product and your satellite can be into any other type product. The percentage between core and satellite would depend on your investment appetite.",0.9489,1722415758

Looking at any index or investment from only a returns perspective may not be the right way to build a portfolio. It's important to consider all aspects of risk while investing/ building a portfolio.

Nifty 500 offers a more diversified way of investing in the Indian markets but might be more volatile because it covers smaller companies as well. If your objective is to track the India growth story, Nifty 500 might be a more wholesome index.

Both S&P 500 & Nifty 500 provides exposure to Top 500 companies of different countries i.e. USA and India respectively.

Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) as the name suggests are traded on exchange and investors can invest in the Funds just like they do investment in any company shares.¬†

For an ETF, one necessarily needs to have a demat & trading account which is not the case with any normal mutual fund.

From a returns perspective, ETFs and Index Funds work in a similar way as the scheme returns are generated based on the underlying investments.

All the investors are allotted units at a NAV which can be referred to as price per unit.¬†

A simple example to understand the working of ETF -

Lets assume the ETF has AUM of 100 Cr on Day 1 with 1 Cr outstanding units. Therefore NAV on Day 1 is 100 (100 cr/ 1 cr).

The underlying index increases by 10% during the year. Expense ratio is 0.3% which goes to the AMC.

Assuming no new inflows and outflows during the year. AUM at the end year will become 109.7 cr (100 Cr + 10 Cr - 0.3 cr).

NAV at the end of the year will be 109.7 (109.7 cr AUM / 1 cr units).

ETFs provide the flexibility of investing through¬†the stock exchange during the day whereas in Index funds, one gets the end of the day NAV.

Both structures work. If you have a broking & demat account and are a regular investor in the markets, I would suggest to use ETFs as they work just like stocks and so have a similar ecosystem.

ETFs provide the flexibility of investing through¬†the stock exchange during the day whereas in Index funds, one gets the end of the day NAV.

Both structures work. If you have a broking & demat account and are a regular investor in the markets, I would suggest to use ETFs as they work just like stocks and so have a similar ecosystem.

If not, then use Index Funds & FOFs. This route may also be easier to do SIPs and if you prefer those investments to be made on autopilot.

It goes without saying that based on your financial objectives, have an asset allocation mix across Equity, Debt and Commodity.

Debt funds are taxed at an individual's income tax slab. There has been no change in the tax rate for the fixed income products.

&#x200B;

**1) Lack of growth:**

Lack of growth in the economy, in general, has caused investors to go after the high valuation safe companies mostly in the FMCG sector. Take a look at HUL, Nestle, Britannia, Asian Paints. All those companies are having valuations of a raging bull startup while having growth in early teens. Their stable growth in an unstable growth environment has made them attractive in past 4-5 years and because of that factor, they not only enjoy high PE valuations but also commend high weightage in the index than a company with similar earning in a different sector. (HUL vs HCL). Add surging Reliance touching never seen before valuations, you can easily see how Nifty has expanded without earnings growth to back it up.

**2) Washed out quarters:**

If you take a look at IOC's June quarter, Axis Bank's March quarter or M&M's March quarter, you can clearly see their TTM earnings getting battered due to a single weak quarter. During a recession like this, such valuations like this remain until economic activities go back to normal.

> **Vanguard‚Äôs $55bn fixed income ETF hit by price dislocation**

> * Extremely volatile conditions across the US fixed income market because of the coronavirus pandemic have led to a highly unusual pricing dislocation in Vanguard‚Äôs $55bn total bond market exchange traded fund, one of the world‚Äôs largest ETFs.

> * The ETF, known by its ticker BND, saw the gap between its closing price and the net asset value of the fund surge to a **6.2 per cent discount** on March 12 (later narrowed to 1.5%).

> * BlackRock runs a directly competing ETF known as AGG. The discount for AGG widened to 4.43 per cent on March 12 and has since narrowed to 1.44 per cent. 

> * Vanguard‚Äôs fixed income ETF range had been trading at discounts ranging from 1 per cent to 4 per cent over the past two weeks.

In short, in extreme volatile conditions like these days, the prices of ETFs can diverge significantly from the underlying individual securities, even with the world's largest ETF providers. Arbitrage opportunities are not easy to do with large volumes and extreme bidirectional volatility. 

In this particular case, SBI Nifty ETF is 64,000 crore fund, which is by itself the biggest equity fund in our market. A 10% up or down is 6400 crore valuation amount. No wonder, we don't have liquidity to manage that. Huge amounts cannot be expected to be nimble too. 

IOW, if someone (retail investor) has invested in SBI Nifty ETF, there is no particular reason to sell it in extreme volatile conditions unless it is very profitable to you.

The price in the exchange, any exchange, is just that of the last trade.   In typical situations, the bids and asks  (buy orders and sell orders) would be around the last price and the orders can be matched.  If there are few orders,  or if there are only bids and no asks or vice verca, the matching may not happen and there could be a large gap. 

For an ETF, the market maker has to deal with entire units. Please note that they can't buy the shares from the AMC  - they buy the shares in the market and make units.  So ETFs can get affected more than stocks in extreme markets. And definitely the markets have been extreme in the last few days.

This is not a tracking error. For an ETF, tracking error is when the NAV deviates from the index. Not when the Market Price deviates. This is happening because of SBI's market makers not doing their jobs.  

> SBI Nifty 50 ETF closed 0.5% down when the markets were 8% down yesterday. 

How was market down 8%?

Nifty closing price on Monday was 9197.4 & Yesterday's closing price was 8967.05. That's 2.5% down. Not 8%.  

> People looking to invest in an index at this point should go for an index fund instead of ETF

Index funds have had different issues in these volatile market.  

Let's take Friday. You saw the market go down 10% in the morning & decided to buy the dip & placed an order. By EOD, Nifty was 5+% up - a total swing of 15+%. So the price you got the Index Fund MF was 15+% higher than what you thought you were buying it at.

I would still marginally prefer ETFs to Index funds in days of such volatility. Just do due diligence.  

- Compare previous day's closing price & NAV. See if they are fairly matching (1-2% should be ok for these times)   
- Check current price when you decide to buy. Compare the %age fall or rise from yesterday's closing price to the fall/rise in Nifty - see if they fairly match (Again give a 1-2% margin).   
- Then place a limit order and not a market order",0.8795,1584498988

1. Why can't the FoF insist on creating the ETF units (rather than investing in the secondary market). Is the ticket size for FoF investment not big enough? I would assume ETF unit creation would be on iNAV basis and not based on last traded price of ETF.

2. Stop inflows into equities(moderate) - Stop my SIPS while maintaining my existing portfolio. New investments go into debt.

3. Rebalance(active) - this is what I have done here and exited my equity positions and moved them into debt. I believe that debt right now offers higher returns and that once I find that markets are attractively valued either through a correction or a few years of being flat, I can rebalance again.

If you find Nifty PE ‚Äúexpensive‚Äù vs itself it‚Äôs literally meaningless. 

How is it meaningless? It means that the prices of the stocks are much more than what they used to command in the past for similar earning. If you are investing in the stock market I assume you care for what the companies are actually doing, because that's how your investments appreciate (I'm assuming long term here, and not shorts or other tricks). You really need to know that you aren't buying stocks when they are inflated. While PE isn't the only indicator, it surely is one good indicator.

2. For latest numbers like company specific financials, estimates and other data I have access to a data provider. [Damodaran's website](http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/datacurrent.html) is also a treasure trove of information.

3. A lot the models I use are actually just the spreadsheets in [here](http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/spreadsh.htm#ginzumodels).  The focused valuation models are the go-to ones. The multiples ones are pretty easy to use as well.

Well, I agree interactive brokers are a bit on the pricier side, but they have a much more robust platform - and most things are included in it, especially the APIs. Ameritrade is a cheaper alternative.

Also, as an industry insider, 0 brokerage is mostly a sham. For example, TD Ameritrade, Fidelity and Interactive Brokers all offer no transaction fee funds (around 4000), but I'm yet to see a ECN broker who has 0 brokerage on stocks.

If you look at it, the highest fee would be 0.0035 per share, subject to a minimum of 35 cents per order.

My point is, your taxes become complicated when you have international stock holdings. You need to file for exemptions in the country you hold them, then file in India. For instance, if you're in the US, you have to fill out your W8-BEN. Any withheld taxes need to be claimed back. And then you need to file taxes in India.

Secondly, the performance comparison is made with just two schemes and hence to say that investing in NITFY ETF ""is better than investing in Mutual Funds""  is IMHO a distortion of the facts. Thirdly, any comparison, for it to be meaningful should either be done over a full market cycle or over rolling periods.  It reminds me of a saying about statistics:

So last night when I got hold of some specific data with similar complain about MFs, I thought of sharing my thoughts.

My main point is, investors should not just believe return numbers given out by fund houses. While they keep harping on SIPs, many time it happens that the returns on the ground vary vastly from the point to point returns given out by fund houses. Investors should keep a keen eye on their funds' performance and compare it against the NIFTY ETF ... after all they are paying decent fund management fees when they buy MFs.

ETFs are efficient and return wise it will be slightly better than index funds.  I am not sure if you see that much difference when you determine the Total cost of ownership. It should be around 10bps difference.

Generally, The TCO of a ETF would be = expense ratio + brokerage charges + bid/ask spread + tracking error

You also have to add annual demat and trading maintenance in the calculation. 

 For ETFs I believe, There is no STT on buying, negligible on selling(0.001%) [here](https://markets.livemint.com/mutual-fund/mutual-fund-news/In-India-ETFs-are-still-at-a-nascent-stage-and-the-retail-participation-is-very-low-930813). I don't have zerodha charges handy, a lot of people here use it, They can hopefully help with the charges breakdown. 

Also if you are used to SIP kind of automated investments then full-service providers(icici direct, sherkhan etc) provides this service but their brokerage charge is more. Not sure if zerodha does.

For someone who wants to enter into passive investments and don't want to take any trouble of opening and maintaining a trading and demat account, index fund is great option. The expense charges will further go down as AUM grows. A few years back index funds and ETFs  had 1-2 percent expense ratio, Their performance was pathetic with respect to the benchmark. The expenses have drastically came down in recent times.

At a very rudimentary level, NIFTY's PE ratio is the index value divided by the cumulative EPS of its constituent shares. (NIFTY PE Ratio = NIFTY / EPS)

Now EPS is essentially profits divided by the number of shares. (EPS = Profit after tax / number  of shares)

The NSE decided to change the calculation methodology to include consolidated profits instead of only standalone profits. Then essentially means profits of subsidiaries are also included included from now on instead of just the profits of the mothership.

Large Indian corporates such as ITC, Reliance, Asian Paints have profitable subsidiaries. Now that the profit amount is larger, we have a higher EPS number.

There will be changes but it's gonna be minor, until and unless some black swan event happens, which is quiet rare.

Lower PE is good coz it means Nifty is fairly valued. Lower the PE cheaper the Value.

>All I'm trying to say is that the ratio staying above 25 is not really rare anymore. 

Do you understand what you just said? I don't think you do :)

In a world where the returns occur via dividends alone, PE is a measure of how long an investor needs to wait to make as much money as he has invested - ie, double his investment. 

There is a reason why PE just cant stay high forever. A PE of 25 means that one is willing to wait for 25 years for a return equal to capital invested. That's a cagr of just a little over 2.75% over 25 years. If equity, one of the most risky things to invest in has such meagre returns for so long, then what should be the condition of other investment avenues? 

Let me repeat that again - you just predicted a returns from the nifty 50 in the range of 2.75% per annum for the next 25 years.

Does that sound normal to you? What do you think will happen to the country's growth when your industry is growing at those low rates?

Of course I'm simplifying the story a lot because I have neglected earnings growth. But my point was to show why a PE can't remain arbitrarily high forever - because if it does despite earnings growth, then the situation looks like what I described above. 

People are just fooling themselves when they think we have reached an age of permanently raised PEs. It hasn't sustained for over 100 years in the US and I don't see why it'll sustain now. It doesn't sustain because people aren't willing to wait for 25 years to double their money in nominal terms.",-0.3469,1570587326

"Nifty P/E Ratio is at record high level, do you think the stock market can still go higher than current levels?","I'm expecting you to give an honest answer: what's your total XIRR from your stock portfolio?

Before you provide a number off the top of your head, you can do this:

- open an excel sheet / Google spreadsheet
- write down each and every purchase of yours, in amount, with date stamp next to it.

   every row should be used for a different purchase, with transaction date next to it. Make sure to put a minus before amount (cash outflow, going into the asset).

- next, write the dates of cash outflow, in the form of tax payment, AMC & brokerage charges etc.; along with date stamp.

   This would also have negative / minus sign in front of the amount, because money is going out of your pocket.

- in the final row, enter today's date, and latest valuation of your stock portfolio.

   This one would have a plus sign in front of the amount. Because if you were to redeem, you'd get this amount back (cash inflow).

- Finally, invoke `=xirr()` in a cell in the sheet, and give it two ranges - cell range for the amounts, cell range for the transaction dates

Use formatting to format the output into percentage.

After you've done this, create another similar report; this time simulating your equity purchase transactions in Nifty BeES ETF, and purchase in Quantum Liquid Direct Growth for every cash-equivalent or debt fund transactions.

Then compute XIRR for this set.

If one is not supposed to buy above 25, then one would have been sitting out of the market for over 75% of the time in the last 3 years. Were you sitting out of the market for over 75% of the time in the last 3 years? Did you not find any opportunities to buy and profit in that time period?

If the middleman adds value and reduces overhead, why would you want to directly jump into stocks?

Someone with 100 INR / month can invest in an index fund like IDFC Nifty. But if the same person wants to acquire each stock in Nifty to construct a Nifty portfolio of his own, it'd cost him about ~30L to make sure all stocks are in similar weight as they are in Nifty, and there's at least 1 stock of each company.

Assuming your concern is expense ratio, you could look at low TER funds. Index funds and ETFs have much lower TERs, but even then, don't judge a fund on high TER alone.

That higher TER is justified, because it's shielding you the investor, from lot of paperwork and compliance issues.

I [23M] have roughly INR 40K to invest per month. I am all ears for good allocation ideas.,"Hello, I started my journey 1 and a half year prior and I have done quite a research. So, let me help you a bit.   
1)  
 RD: I started this 5 months ago. For me, the concept of emergency isn't there, as if things go wron,g you can just move back to your parents' home or ask them for help. Honestly, this isn't US, where you have no relation with your parents but needless to say RD is still important. I did it for investment/emergency. Now the strat you wanna follow is you do RD for a small amount of tim,e let's 18/24 months. Then you do 3-4 FD from that amount moving forward. This helps you in 2 ways. first your money is insured upto 5 lakhs in FD/RD. second in case of emergency you don't need to break full FD. For eg: if your emergency only 20000 and you got 4 FDs of 20000, you only need to break 1.   
2)   
Equity: This should be your main focus in particular. The mistake i did was along with SIP i invested in individual stocks with some leftover money and those need focus, which is a bad thing. Now, invest in any SIP it doesn't matter much.  
3)   
International Equity: I will suggest you against it. You want to diversify your portfolio not complicate it. The govt changed their stance on it frequently and the fund house doesn't reflect one on one to international NASDAQ and S&P500. I have invested once in it so far just for the sake of it. So, you can do that too once a year or something.   
4)   
Again, No point. If you got EPF by the company, it's more than enough otherwise, just other options. This is for retirement so are others but without limitation.   
5)  
 SGB was quite a good investment. I was able to get to invest in one but gold price soared like crazy and 2.5% guarantee by govt made govt drop this scheme. If it comes back in future which i doubt you can invest in it but remember it has some min purchase of 1g of gold which is 10k atm. otherwise like international buy physical gold once in a while for emergency where the state/country is in war(only gold works at that time)   
6)   
No use. just waste of money and attention. In the future, you can just use one of you SIP or home loan to buy a complete property or land.

Now other tips:   
1)  
 The most imp one: Upskill. while the above can give returns of 7-12% this one can give you return of 5-10% on avg and then you will have more money to invest and it will compound it with those returns plus it will insure you have a job. Spend some money on courses or learning skill or something.   
2)   
Have a goal. The point of invest isn't for the sake of it. It's for goals like you retirement, children, home, car or so on. People forget why they are sacrificing today for tomorrow.   
3)  
 Have fun. One Life one time to enjoy. Try travel somewhere, try something better to eat, wear or experience. your wish honestly but this is important. Money is just a number on screen, experience is live. you will be old if you just keep on saving.

Well that's everything from my my side. The specific amount you can decide on your own.",0.9192,1746201391
I [23M] have roughly INR 40K to invest per month.

For Gold - Keep it simple with the Goldbees rather than the SGB since new SGB may not be launched. 

REIT's just give dividends but don't grow much based on the available historical data and the foreseeable future. (Subject to change based on the changes in the regulation by the regulators).

I [23M] have roughly INR 40K to invest per month. I am all ears for good allocation ideas.,"I think your plan needs to wait.
First; since you are 23, build a solid base for your long term well being and security.

First thing to do would be to get a term insurance plan. You can look for a 2Cr plan with coverage of 80yrs from a leading company like Max health. You can Ideally opt for pay in 10 years so that by 33 you have one less item to put money into every year, also at 23 you'll get the lowest premiums as term plan costs increase as your grow older.

2nd, get a health insurance if you don't have one or if your company doesn't provide for. Don't just look at personal insurance but also insurance of dependant - the idea is, if something happens to someone you are responsible for, it shouldn't require you to sell assets or take on more liability

3rd - build an emergency fund. If you try yo build it via RDs, it'll take a long period to accumulate and in today's market most jobs are not that stable to rely on.. think about this - if i lose my job tomorrow and have to sit at home for 6months, what will I do? Emergency fund should be primarily focus before all else. You can do this via FD investments on Stable money and/or automate sweep fd with your bank. Don't do step 4 till you have a confident pool of emergency funds.

4th - start with SIPs, invest in parag parikh flexi cap, a good index fund and one small cap fund in 40-40-20 ratio. The amount should be not the max you can save but the min you can set aside against future expenses. You are still young and slowly responsibilities will grow, so don't start with large SIPs instead make lumpsump contributions whenever you have additional flow.

5th - if you are keen to invest in gold and someday buy real estate - please invest money for this in something safe even if rate of return is low. For gold you can use platforms like Gullak or Jar to save in gold and for more long term goals - put the money into stable investment plans like FD or index funds 

Hope this helps. Give yourself some credit; most folks your age are not thinking on this - so you are already on the right track",0.9898,1746335347

I am assuming you would be in a good tax bracket and hopefully in the highest bracket soon I see it as a sign of financial progress so I mean it as a compliment.

Some notes (and not financial advise)

1. Personally I have gone with NIFTY 100 or some combination of NIFTY 50 + NIFTY NEXT 50 for large cap investment instead of simply NIFTY 50. Personally I like parag parikh so not sure if I would invest less in PPFAS over index fund. If I dont like the scheme or am suspicious I would possibly eliminate it in favor of index fund.

2. Your distribution just considering NIFTY 50, mid and smallcap, is more like NIFTY MULTICAP 50: 31.25: 18.75 barring the fact that you have considered NIFTY 50 instead of NIFTY 100. If that is your intention you can get the same returns by using right index fund sips in different proportions. My intention of index fund is usually to eliminate fund manager risk with a positive side effect of reduced expense ratio.

3. International Equity is US only (that is ok if its a thoughtful decision but if its goal is to diversify then you might consider a more global equity fund). My family member has invested in Axis Global Alpha Fund of Fund. The underlying fund has exposure to some markets other than US but US is where majority is invested. Another option is hdfc world indexes fund of fund. I hope one day we get etf which tracks msci world index. you might want to check with your financial advisor.

4. If RD is taxed like FD then you are bearing taxes even when you are not using one. You might want to check with your financial advisor on liquid funds or short term funds.

5. PPF contribution seems less, should be fine if you have decent PF contribution. Personally I prefer PF (rate of return is usually higher) and then PPF because of exempt nature. check with your advisor if partial withdrawal on PPF and associated taxation and then decide between PPF and RD. You can also check for VPF if you have that option as typically I have found PF related interest to be higher than PPF. But I dont think VPF for emergency will be a good option.

6. Not sure about SIP in SGB tranche I have usually only invested in gold mf or etf so dont know about it. But gold as a means of diversification makes sense.

  
On a side note

I do keep some cash aside in liquid mf or arbitrage funds for favorable times to invest. Eg when there is a correction or so.

I am no financial advisor and do not take this as financial or investment advice.

IMO just go heavy on equities and be flexi able with ur exit to avoid exit risk. You are doing a monthly SIP so u have no entry risk.

Secondly,Investing in a Hang Seng ETF can provide valuable diversification and exposure to the dynamic Hong Kong and Chinese markets. In 2025, these ETFs have demonstrated strong performance, with the Nippon India ETF Hang Seng BeES delivering a 1-year return of 60.42% as of March 2025  . This growth is driven by robust earnings from major tech firms, supportive government policies, and advancements in artificial intelligence  .

The Hang Seng Index offers access to leading companies across sectors like finance, technology, and consumer goods, including Tencent, Alibaba, and HSBC  . Additionally, ETFs like the Mirae Asset Hang Seng TECH ETF focus on the 30 largest technology companies listed in Hong Kong, providing targeted exposure to the rapidly expanding tech sector  .

However, it's important to consider potential risks. The Hang Seng Index is heavily weighted towards financials and real estate, which may pose sector-specific risks  . Investments are also subject to fluctuations in the Hong Kong dollar, potentially affecting returns  . Moreover, political developments in Hong Kong and China can influence market performance  .

For Indian investors, allocating a portion of your portfolio to Hang Seng ETFs can enhance diversification and offer exposure to high-growth markets. However, it's essential to assess these benefits against the associated risks and align them with your investment goals  .",0.9826,1746187501

I'm not sure what you're saying at all. 

How is earnings a matter of concern for a PB ratio? The only way earnings enters the picture here is via Price and there is a specific ratio for measuring that - PE.

But going by that itself the PB is supposed to be ***lower***, (not higher) because you have inflated assets sitting in the balance sheet - higher the book value (denominator) lower the PB. 

And as assets get depreciated away the PB rises (assuming constant stock price), not falls. That's the exact opposite of your claim. 

And there is another factor at play here - although I haven't looked into what's the level of its cumulative and temporal impact. It's the fact that IT services firms, by their very nature are low on Book value and as their weight age in the index rises, that directly affect the effective PB of the index itself.

Maybe you misspoke...

But, investors who invested in NFO, and then continued investing (FreeFincal's Pattu, for example), have lower / higher returns than that, depending on what they'd invested in last 7 years, and by which amount.

For instance, Pattu has an XIRR of 11.66% from this fund despite regularly investing in it since NFO.

Given the number of index funds & ETFs in Nifty Index space, it's easy to see a mere 1700 Cr. fund won't have any issue trading & growing its AUM.

Up until 2014-15, it had a great 10 year record, handily beating Sensex TRI (that was its benchmark), riding on the wave of _fund falls less than market when drawdowns happen, generating alpha_.

Why is it that Nifty PE is almost 30 and no one cares?,"Yes, not tomorrow - but what about this year? Or the next?

Let's do a simple thought experiment. 

Because with that line of thinking there are 2 independent possibilities for each of earnings and stock price. 

1. Earnings increases in the near future.
2. Earnings doesn't increase in the near future.
3. Stock price increases in the near future.
4. Stock price doesn't increase in the near future.

1, 3 maintains PE (or doesn't bring it down fast enough)

1, 4 means the PE is getting justified (your bullish case)

2, 3 inflates PE even further

2, 4 maintains the PE.

Only 1 out of 4 outcomes support a bullish case. Now yes, I don't know the relative probabilities of these four possibilities. So let's try something else. 

Let's assume that you are right, that we are indeed looking at a case of 1, 4 in the future, ie the earnings are going to grow or you're looking at a growing economy in general. 
Now let me introduce the discrepancy between the nifty50 and the other Indian indices. Again 2 possibilities:

5. Nifty50 is fairly valued (which means the others are undervalued)

6. Nifty50 is overvalued (the others are fairly valued)

But we just said that we expect the economy to grow, and that's why the high valuation of nifty50 is justified. Then why don't we look at mid and small caps and buy them at a bargain expecting a rising economy to lift all ships?

Yes, I'm aware of the simplistic nature of that argument above, but I strongly feel that there's is inconsistencies in the growth argument and the current pricing of nifty50 vs the other cap indices. Here's something to keep in mind - As of yesterday the nifty 100 has a PE of 30.99, PB of 3.85 while for the Midcap 150 it's 33.22 and 2.96 and for the small cap 250 it's 30.78 and 2.13 respectively. What does that tell you? 

Of course, only time will tell the full story.",0.987,1559073478
Why is it that Nifty PE is almost 30 and no one cares?,"Well the goal is not improve the P/E, per se. It's a trailing indicator after-all. Price is about future earnings, earnings is about past earnings. In more extreme growth cases even negative multiples seem perfectly permissible. 

So I would not think in terms of P/E ratio, but rather just see it as one indicator for how much growth is expected.

As for the second point, I think that's a fair point, Nifty 50 may not be the most optimal collection of stocks. We don't know, but it's safe to say that it's probably not.

But risk and liquidity adjusted, that discrepancy in ratios is not bad. It's not an exact science so these relatively small gaps shouldn't be looked into too much. 31 vs 33 is the margin of error, could have been 33 vs 31, who knows? The future is full of randomness and it's fine if this is the level of discrepancy, can't exactly say one is overvalued or not. Ratios aren't perfect measures. Earnings can be manipulated easily and so can book values.

If it was 20 vs 30, then that's a clear sign. But something that's within 25% of each other, that's not going to be significant over the long run.",0.9853,1559077472
Why is it that Nifty PE is almost 30 and no one cares?,"PE should be a trailing measure because that's what's real. Future or expected PE is wonky because that's precisely where discrepancies come from - mismatch of expectations vs reality.

And no, PE cannot be negative. When companies are making losses, we don't define a PE for them. 

Actually, have you seen this? I have a feeling that you aren't aware of how far away from the mean we are right now in terms of pricing for the nifty50 stocks. 
https://nifty-pe-ratio.com/

What some of us are saying is that the PE is so high right now, so far off from the average that we need exceptional earnings to justify it in the near future - and we don't see why the market is going to see such unheard of earnings.

I understand PE is priced for expectations, but do you realize how far off from the mean we are right now? What do you think happens when euphoric expectations aren't met? :)",0.6725,1559104986
Why is it that Nifty PE is almost 30 and no one cares?,"1) Forget P/E as the primary indicator. It‚Äôs one, trailing indicator of what kind of growth is expected in the future. 

2) The point of negative P/E was not to say we should use them, but rather to illustrate that it‚Äôs the future that matters for price not trailing earnings. Negative P/E are just extreme cases where super high growth is expected.

3) P/E is higher than historical average. True, but that‚Äôs just a problem for near term. Think of it this way. Take the P/E at some time in the past, say 15 years or whatever. And then imagine the P/E ratio then is the same as today.

The analytical question to ask is if at that time would you take the bet with today‚Äôs P/E ratio? Would you get good returns over the long run? And the answer is yes.

And that‚Äôs the bet to make today as well.

Why is it that Nifty PE is almost 30 and no one cares?,"
>The analytical question to ask is if at that time would you take the bet with today‚Äôs P/E ratio? Would you get good returns over the long run? And the answer is yes.

The answer is not yes. If you took the bet then at higher PEs, you'd have lesser gains now (than what actually happened in real life) because you paid inflated prices for those stocks (compared to their market value/fair value). That's assuming long term fixes any short term pricing issues.

You're literally saying you'd have paid more for shares in the past than they were worth (and selling for) and it'd have made you more money now? That's backwards. I don't get it. 

And yes, that's precisely the bet to make today too. That at inflated PEs you need inflated earnings in the future and we can't really see wheres those earning going to come from. Make in India came and went, demonetisation came and went. Where is the new earnings growth going to come from? Sense dividend yeild is trending lower, not higher.


>Negative P/E are just extreme cases where super high growth is expected.

Nope. There is no such thing as a negative PE. A Company not earning money is losing it, there is no denominator for such a case to even compute a PE ratio. Even if you define a new PE as price-per-share/losses-per-share, a super high numerical value is a company that's lost the least amount of money. 


>Forget P/E as the primary indicator. It‚Äôs one, trailing indicator of what kind of growth is expected in the future.

Okay, so where's the higher earnings going to come from? Not just simply higher earnings, but Higher earnings at are increasing at rates never seen in the past. You are saying that the country's economy is going to increase its growth *rate* as well?

The PE is not an expectation, the PE is a measure of the state of stock markets. There is a big difference. That you can use it as a proxy for expected growth doesn't mean that the growth is magically going to come out of thin air. In the long term the stock market plays by fundamentals, not expectations.",0.9839,1559123796
Why is it that Nifty PE is almost 30 and no one cares?,"You are failing to understand. Say the PE in the past was not what it was, but what it is today. Would it still have been a good bet? Yes. Saying the return would have been lower than a lower P/E is obvious and was not the point. 

In other words, just because it was/is expensive does not mean it was/ is a bad bet.

Secondly you have missed the forest for the trees in the negative PE. I am NOT calling for negative PE to be an idcator. It was to show that‚Äôs it‚Äôs not the be all and end all, especially in a growth case.

For example (not about your specific company, but hypothetically) What use is a P/E number if the promoters cannot be trusted? ",-0.4559,1532796095
Nifty Smallcap 100. The biggest collapse and the biggest opportunity in last 6 years.,"Firstly buyback does not make any sense if there is no premium because nobody will tender their shares for buyback otherwise. The other thing is not everyone who tenders their shares will get a buyback. Its similar to the IPO application. And the most important thing is that buybacks are done in two major scenarios: 

1) Company has a lot of cash and wishes to give it back to shareholders or feels the market is undervaluing them significantly and wants to buy their own stock. 

2) Company is going through tough times in terms of corporate governance reputation and they attempt to fix the fall in share prices through these announcements. 

If the case is 1 then there is no need to worry and you can bet for the buyback. Worst case you wont get the buyback but the market will take the traded price pretty close to the buyback price. But if the case is 2 and your shares dont get bought back then you are stuck with the stock. 

That being said, I read the whole AR of weizmann.. studied their balance sheet and the only red flags I see are

a.  an sudden increase in trade receivables to (5,741.34) in FY18 from (1,258.66) in FY17
b. Other comprehensive Income increase to 2,012.83 in FY18 from 650.14 in FY17.

1.  I remember looking at NV 20 at 50/- sometime in June and looking at underlying portfolio for index looked really good, But I too stopped because of 2 reasons - 1) as was expecting that market will crash by Nov. 2) The Liquidity of this with no bottom on a crash day, if that happens. 

2. I reviewed thru the ETF portfolio then and looked good for Long term to buy-and-forget cases. Long term. (Risk adjusted returns)

3. Liquidity part you can google and read article as to how Nifty 50 based ETF have overall crossed 1 Trillion Rupees in managed fund.

Correlation between S&P 500 INR and Nifty 50 : -0.35?,"Is there a reason why you're using daily values? If you don't have a _specifc_ reason, that's almost certainly skewing your numbers.

Correlation is a measure of how two values change - direction and magnitude. By taking daily values you're making your numbers inherently reflect the day to day noise-like variables strongly.

I'm not saying the values will change drastically, but in general for your intent - how to diversify (I guess?) - you should use data that actually measures the values at a slower rate. Something like weekly returns or perhaps even better, monthly returns are what I'd recommend.

There are lies, damned lies and statistics ;)

That said, I'd not probably want to stick all my money in just the _better_ index. Where you live and where you spend the investment are important factors that are not to be forgotten when making investments.

I don't want to give you the answer. I'd like to make you think instead. 

What if you took this thought to the extreme and pick out per-tick data and look for correlation? What do you expect to find? Don't run data analysis until you have an answer to this question (and an argument for why it should be so). Analysis is most useful when you are testing a hypothesis.

NSE considers caps on Nifty's sector weights; move may hit financial stocks,"This makes no sense whatsoever. Certain sectors will always outweigh in terms of market cap because said sectors are currently the brightest spots of the economy with respect to other sectors. When these sectors face a downturn or if potential troubles are in sight then market participants will automatically start offloading the stocks of these sectors. Nifty 50 is no longer an inefficient index that takes a lot of time to respond to developments in the industry. Considering the sheer number of DIIs and FIIs that trade various Nifty 50 stocks on a daily basis, I would argue that the index as whole might be better at mitigating risk than even the most competent fund manager.

This is something I picked by listening to a talk by R Janakiraman from Franklin Templeton, who manages the Franklin India Smaller Companies Fund; I'm given to believe the fund constituents \(mid and small caps\) are also chosen in a similar manner.

So, if you are not confident about midcaps for the next 3 years, they shouldn't be in your portfolio. Surely you could have bought them at lower prices. Surely there are a million other possible situations that could have played out, but you're here with this portfolio, and you need to make a choice without endowment bias.

I agree we need to have a significant part of our portfolio in low volatile funds like the ones you listed above.

But the majority of the funds must be in high volatile indices. Like the NN50. It gives us opportunities to enter and exit especially for people who are quite passive about investing.


Of course, if people start freaking out during market crashes where highly volatile funds are usually hit harder then low volatility probably makes sense. Or maybe it doesn't, I wonder that's enough to not panic anyway for such investors.

Nifty Strategy Indices,"> And as far as liquidity goes, I think the ETF AP takes care of creating new shares/units if needed? So shouldn't be a very huge issue?

The liquidity issues I mentioned is about selling the units easily. It doesn't matter how many units are created. If very few unit are traded on a regular basis, it'll be difficult to sell the ETFs when we need to.

> The only downside I see for these ETFs is low volume and higher tracking errors.

These downsides are something worth considering. High tracking error means we'd buy the ETF for more than its worth, since there'll be fluctuations between the Price and NAV. Low volume means the ETF price will be volatile if we buy or sell large number of units.

> I agree with the issue you mentioned, but looks like even with the issues they beat the NIFTY 50 index over time.

I agree that the index has considerably beaten the Nifty 50. But, make sure to analyse past data too. For the last 5 years, they would have performed well. 5 years is a small timeframe to analyse the performance. Check the last 20 years or 30 years data of the index.
